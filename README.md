# Ludum Dare 49

## Topic selection
Unstable can be interpreted in many ways. Since we are from Germany and our country is famous and notorious for their unstable network, we decided to make network instability and lag the main theme of our game.

## This is L.A.G.
L.A.G. is a mix of roguelike and obstacle course where the goal is to move through the level with constantly changing ping. It's not so much about steering the controllable protagonist past the obstacles and puzzles and getting him to the finish line, but more about his - ping influenced - lagging real mind.

If you make it through a timed door, for example, but the limping real ghost doesn't, you are reset and have to try again.

*Secret tip: Sometimes it can make sense to use high lag spikes to your advantage to cross obstacles or solve puzzles. Maybe you can even get through some levels only under worst conditions?*

<details>
  <summary>Attention: Solution! Read only if you can't get any further at all in the last room</summary>
  When the ping is red, run against a wall that is not too far away from the next room. Since the ping is so bad, you may glitch through the wall.

Now try yourself: Control the lag and learn to cope with the unstable computer network.

## Controls
- **WASD** to move through the level
- Use **E** to interact with the world
